Creating a typing effect in CSS that can handle any word given to it dynamically is a bit more complex because CSS alone doesn't have built-in support for content manipulation. However, we can achieve a typing effect for predefined text using CSS animations and keyframes. To make it handle any given word dynamically, we'd typically combine CSS with JavaScript.

Below, I'll show you two methods:

    CSS-Only Method: A typing effect for predefined words.
    CSS with JavaScript: A typing effect that dynamically handles any given word.

1. CSS-Only Typing Effect for Predefined Words

This method works if you know the word beforehand and can hard-code it. We will use the width property to reveal the text gradually.
