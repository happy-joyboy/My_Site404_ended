            <p>I'm Saeed Khalid, a 3rd-year engineering student with a passion for self-learning and skill development. My journey in the tech world has led me to gain knowledge in HTML, CSS, Python, Java, and C++. I'm particularly fascinated by the dynamic fields of cybersecurity and web development, which I'm currently exploring in depth. I enjoy the challenge of solving complex problems and continually expanding my technical skill set.</p>
